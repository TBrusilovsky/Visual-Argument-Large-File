##Overconsumption##
#By Thomas Brusilovsky#

This Visual Argument is titled 'Overconsupmtion' and depicts the looming monster of overconsumption and pollution threatening to consume the world whole. The monster is faintly overlayed with the image of the trash and waste of millions of people, which is building up to a truely unmanagable level in landfills around the world. The earth is also overlayed with an image of an oil pump, showing how fossil fuels are helping bring on this disaster. In the bottom left there is text that speaks about the issues we are facing and empasizes the point of the visual argument.
